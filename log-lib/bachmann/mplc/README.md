## Core

The core library is based on CoDeSys V2, the .EXP source files are generated.

## Building

The M-Plc project log-lib-all.pro can be used for building the source .EXP files. This empty project contains a number of macro's for importing the source.
Choose 'Edit->Macros->Import core' for example to import the core sources. In case of any error messages choose 'Project->Clean all' and/or 'Project->Rebuild all', compile information from a previous build can cause problems if those source files are no longer available.
